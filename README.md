# **Admission System**

This project implements a modular **Admission System** using **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It uses **design patterns** such as **Pipeline**, **Filter**, and **Observer** to streamline the selection process for candidates through various stages of eligibility, fee submission, testing, and interviews.

## **Features**
- Filters candidates based on:
  - Academic performance (Matric and FSC scores)
  - Fee payment status
  - Test scores
  - Interview scores
- Sends notifications to candidates during each stage.
- Implements modular and reusable design patterns.
- Generates a **Merit List** of the top 3 candidates.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Java 8 or later installed.
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (or any Java IDE).

### **Setup**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd admission-system
   ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Ensure the JDK is properly configured:
   - Go to **File > Project Structure > SDK** and select your installed JDK.

### **Running the Application**
1. Navigate to the `AdmissionSystem` class in `src`.
2. Run the `main()` method.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input candidate data and proceed through the admission process.

## **Code Structure**

### **Key Components**
- **Candidate Class**:
  Encapsulates all candidate details and manages their data across the pipeline.

- **Filter Interface**:
  Provides a common structure for implementing various filters:
  - `EligibilityFilter`: Filters candidates based on academic performance.
  - `TestEligibilityFilter`: Filters candidates based on fee submission.
  - `InterviewEligibilityFilter`: Filters candidates based on test scores.
  - `MeritListFilter`: Selects the top candidates based on interview scores.

- **AdmissionPipeline**:
  Processes candidates through a series of filters and notifies observers at each stage.

- **Observer Pattern**:
  Notifies candidates via the `EmailNotifier` class.

---

## **Design Patterns Used**
1. **Pipeline Pattern**: 
   - Sequentially applies multiple filters to process candidates.
2. **Filter Pattern**: 
   - Encapsulates filtering logic for different stages.
3. **Observer Pattern**: 
   - Sends notifications to candidates during each processing stage.

---

## **Sample Flow**
1. **Data Input**:
   Input name, matric marks, and FSC marks for 20 students.
2. **Eligibility Filtering**:
   Filters students with marks >= 60 in Matric and FSC.
3. **Fee Submission**:
   Marks candidates as fee-paid.
4. **Test Score Evaluation**:
   Filters students with test scores > 85.
5. **Interview**:
   Collects interview scores and generates a merit list.

---

## **Example Usage**

Sample input and process:
```plaintext
Enter data for 20 students (name, matric marks, FSC marks):
Name: Ali
Matric Marks: 75
FSC Marks: 80
...
Filtering students based on eligibility...
Eligible students:
Ali [Matric: 75, FSC: 80]

Enter fee submission status for eligible students:
Ali (Fee Paid? true/false): true

Enter test scores for students who submitted fee:
Ali (Test Score): 90

Enter interview scores for students eligible for interview:
Ali (Interview Score): 88

Merit List:
Ali [Matric: 75, FSC: 80]
```
